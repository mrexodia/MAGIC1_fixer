Story:
Also pressed the wrong button when you installed IOS236?
I looked in the source code and found out that there is
just a small piece of code in the memory off the WII that
prevents you from re-installing. The 'fix' is to put in a
real game and play it. But what if your DVD drive of the WII
is DEAD? This is the program that overwrites the bad code with
good code and makes sure that you can run the IOS236 installer
again.


Folders:
	bin	- Contains the files to put on your SD card
	source	- Contains the source code in case you don't trust this release
